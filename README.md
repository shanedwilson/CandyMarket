# Candy Market

### Our Mission
Our primary goal is to make the best candy inventory platform there is. Like any good technology company, we really insist that our platform run as a console app because... reasons.

### Who should apply?
We're a group of young entrepreneurs looking for a rockstar-ninja developer to help us disrupt the candy trading industry. Since we're running an extremely unconventional startup, your compensation certainly won't be conventional. In lieu of a base salary, we're offering competitive stock options valued at nearly $1 billion<sup>*</sup>.

### Our Features
- As a candy owner, I want to be able to keep track of the candy that I receive.
	- The candy information that I want to track is name, manufacturer, flavor category, and the date I received the candy.
- As a candy owner, I want to be able to keep track of the candy that I eat.
	- If I have more that one identical candy, I want to make sure that I eat the piece that I received first so that I don't waste candy.
	- If I only know what flavor of candy that I want to eat, I want an option that will pick a random piece of candy for me in that category. This option should also not waste old candy.
- As a candy owner, I would like to trade with other candy owners registered with our service. Right now we don't have any **_actual_** registered users, but we'd like the feature built with simulated users in anticipation of the hordes of users we'll have once our platform launches.
